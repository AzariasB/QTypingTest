\chapter{Objectives}
The aim of this project is to create a software capable to teach to everyone how to type faster.
The purpose of this guide will be for education and enjoyment.\\
The software will have options to choose the level of the tests. Thanks to this level system, people who do not know how to type will be able to learn, and people who already knows basics will be capable of improving their current speed.\\
The users learning from scratch will be guided from the baseline of the keyboard until the numbers at the second upper-line of the keyboard.\\
The software will be an open-source (under LGPL licence) Qt project. It will be available for the three most-used platform : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Windows
	\item MacOs
	\item Linux
\end{itemize}
 It will be translated in differents
languages (mostly languages from Europeans country) so that no matter your native language, you can learn how to type faster.\\
All tasks will be completed by 1/05/2016.
